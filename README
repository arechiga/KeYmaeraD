 === Notes
scala >=2.9 required -- use of sys.process introduced in 2.9
export SPACEEX=/path/to/spaceex
this is a proof of concept, many details are not well written
//{{{ and //}}} are vim fold markers

 === limitations
modeling:
-formula to verify needs to be changed to the form: h->[hp]f
-not distributed; no quantified assignements / differential equations
-invariants/guards formulas restriced to conjunctions of linear inequalities/equations
proveness:
-LGG formally not sound
-only proves stable systems
platform:
-command line only on linux otherwise virtual machine

 === assumptions
inv_hints and sols parameters of Evolve and Loop are ignorable -- see types.scala
