 === Notes
scala >=2.9 required -- use of sys.process introduced in 2.9
export SPACEEX=/path/to/spaceex
this is a proof of concept, many details are not well written
//{{{ and //}}} are vim fold markers

 === limitations
modeling:
-non linear -- spaceex only supports linear equations although spaceex has plans to support non-linear equations
-not distributed -- technically speaking no quantified assignements/differential_equations supported
-no way found to support invariants/guards beeing an hybrid system -- technically speaking no modalities in invariants/guards supported
-diamond hybrid program
-existencial quantifier
proveness:
-spaceex's LGG scenario formally not sound
-spaceex only proves stable systems
platform:
-spaceex only call-able via command line only on linux otherwise virtual machine needed

 === assumptions
inv_hints and sols parameters of Evolve and Loop are ignore-able -- see types.scala
